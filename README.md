# Global Climate Visualization

The Global Climate Visualization application is a Node.js and Express application designed for environmental awareness and education. It provides an interactive platform to visualize climate data, making complex environmental information accessible through modern web technologies and real-time data integration.

By combining Google Earth Engine data with interactive visualizations, we create a professional product that helps users understand climate patterns and environmental changes worldwide.

- **Historical Climate Time-Lapse**: Interactive visualization showing average annual temperature from 1980 to present
- **AI-Powered Future Prediction**: TensorFlow.js model to predict temperatures for future decades based on location-specific data
- **Real-Time Health Impact**: Display of current Air Quality Index for selected location

### Advanced Features

- **Immersive 3D Impact Visualization**: Cinematic 3D fly-through of selected location landmarks
- **Solutions Layer**: Solar potential visualization and green spaces mapping for any location
- **Personalized Location Analysis**: Address-specific environmental information worldwide

- **Purpose**: Train TensorFlow.js model for location-specific future predictions
- **Predictions**: 2040, 2050, 2060 temperature forecasts for selected location

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following properly installed on your computer:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (v18.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v8.0.0 or higher)
- Google Cloud account with Earth Engine API enabled
- Google Maps API key

## Installing

In a terminal window run these commands:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd google_maps_earth
npm install
```

### Set up Google Earth Engine authentication

1. Create a Google Cloud Project at https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Enable the Earth Engine API for your project
3. Create a service account with the "Earth Engine Resource Admin" role
4. Generate a JSON key file for this service account
5. Save the key file as `privatekey.json` in the root directory of this project
6. Register your service account for Earth Engine access at https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/service_accounts

#### Testing Earth Engine Connection

After setting up your Earth Engine credentials, you can test the connection by running:

```bash
node test-connection.js
```

This script will verify that your authentication is working and that you can access the ERA5 climate dataset used in the application.

### Google Maps API key

The application is already configured with a Google Maps API key:

```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyBR5_tFhPYuUTaaNgvPBbSzy8VnPSZTJNo&libraries=places"></script>
```

If you need to use your own API key, you can replace it in the `public/index.html` file.

### Add necessary environment variables

For production deployment, you may need to add environment variables to your `.env` file or deployment platform:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
GOOGLE_EARTH_ENGINE_KEY=<your-service-account-key-json>
```

### Start the server

You can start the server using npm:

```bash
npm start
```

For development with auto-restart:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or use the provided start script:

```bash
./start.sh
```

If you need to kill any process running on port 3000:

```bash
npm run kill-port
```

### Access the application

You should be able to view the application locally at `http://localhost:3000/`.

#### Testing the Application

You can test if the Earth Engine connection is working correctly by visiting:

```
http://localhost:3000/test
```

This page provides a simple interface to test the Earth Engine API connection and the time-lapse layer generation.
