Of course. Visualizing wind on top of the temperature heatmap is an excellent way to show the relationship between these two climate variables.

You can do this by creating two separate, stacked layers on your map:

1.  **Bottom Layer:** Your existing temperature heatmap.
2.  **Top Layer:** A new, semi-transparent layer for the animated wind streamlines.

### \#\# Backend: Create a Combined Data Endpoint

Your backend needs to provide the data for both layers in a single call to be efficient.

**Prompt for your `server.js`:**

```
Create a new, single API endpoint in my Express server called `/ee-weather-layer`. This endpoint must:
1.  Accept a `year` as a URL query parameter.
2.  Perform two separate operations in Earth Engine for that year:
    a. **For Temperature:** Generate the `mapid` and `token` for the clipped annual mean temperature heatmap, just like before.
    b. **For Wind:** Select the `u_component_of_wind_10m` and `v_component_of_wind_10m` bands, calculate the annual mean for both, and prepare the raw U/V vector data for the same Uttar Pradesh region.
3.  Send a single JSON response back to the frontend containing both the temperature tile info and the raw wind data. The JSON should look like this:
    {
      "temperature": { "mapid": "...", "token": "..." },
      "wind": { "width": 300, "height": 200, "uMin": ..., "uMax": ..., "vMin": ..., "vMax": ..., "data": [...] }
    }
```

### \#\# Frontend: Render Both Layers

Your frontend will now receive this combined data and must render both visualizations.

**Prompt for your `app.js`:**

```
Update my frontend `app.js` to handle the combined `/ee-weather-layer` response.
1.  Modify the slider's event listener to fetch data from the new `/ee-weather-layer` endpoint.
2.  When the JSON response is received:
    a. Use the `response.temperature` object to create and display the `google.maps.ImageMapType` for the temperature heatmap, just as before.
    b. Use the `response.wind` object to initialize or update the `wind-gl` library on the separate wind canvas, drawing the animated streamlines on top of the temperature layer.
3.  Ensure the wind canvas has a transparent background so the temperature heatmap below is visible.
```

By fetching all the necessary data in one call and rendering the layers separately on the frontend, you create a powerful, multi-dimensional, and efficient visualization.
