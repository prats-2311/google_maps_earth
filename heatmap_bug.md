Yes, you've found a classic and important bug. The visualization is the same for every year because your backend server is likely sending the exact same image data to the frontend, even when you request a different year.

This happens when the Earth Engine script is not correctly using the `year` parameter to filter the dataset. It's likely calculating the average temperature over the *entire 40+ year period* every single time, instead of for just the specific year you've selected.

-----

### The Solution: Correct the Backend Logic

The order of operations in your Earth Engine code is critical. You must **filter by date first**, and then calculate the mean.

Here is the corrected logic for your `/ee-timelapse-layer` endpoint in your **`server.js`** file.

**Prompt to fix your code:**

```
"Review and correct my `/ee-timelapse-layer` endpoint in `server.js`. The code should use the `year` query parameter to correctly filter the 'ERA5/DAILY' ImageCollection before calculating the annual mean temperature. Ensure the `.filter(ee.Filter.date(...))` operation is applied before the `.mean()` operation."
```

**Here is the corrected code snippet. Pay close attention to the order:**

```javascript
// Example of your Express endpoint
app.get('/ee-timelapse-layer', (req, res) => {
    try {
        const year = req.query.year;
        if (!year) {
            return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Year parameter is required' });
        }

        // Add this log to your server terminal to confirm the year is being received
        console.log(`Processing request for year: ${year}`);

        // Define the Uttar Pradesh boundary
        const uttarPradeshROI = ee.FeatureCollection('FAO/GAUL/2015/level1')
                                  .filter(ee.Filter.eq('ADM1_NAME', 'Uttar Pradesh'))
                                  .first();

        // 1. Load the full image collection
        const collection = ee.ImageCollection('ERA5/DAILY');

        // 2. **CRITICAL STEP:** Filter the collection for the specific year from the request
        const filteredByYear = collection.filter(ee.Filter.date(`${year}-01-01`, `${year}-12-31`));

        // 3. Select the temperature band and calculate the mean of the *filtered* collection
        const annualMean = filteredByYear.select('mean_2m_air_temperature').mean();

        // 4. Clip the result to the state boundary
        const clippedImage = annualMean.clip(uttarPradeshROI.geometry());
        
        // 5. Define visualization and get map tiles
        const visParams = { min: 15, max: 45, palette: ['#0000FF', '#00FFFF', '#FFFF00', '#FF0000'] };
        
        clippedImage.getMap(visParams, ({ mapid, token }) => {
            res.json({ mapid, token });
        });

    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error processing Earth Engine request:', error);
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to process Earth Engine request' });
    }
});
```

By making sure you filter *before* you calculate the mean, Earth Engine will generate a unique temperature map for each year, and your time-lapse visualization will work correctly.
