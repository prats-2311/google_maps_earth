# Google Maps Earth Project Information

## Summary
This repository contains a blueprint for a climate visualization application focused on Uttar Pradesh, India. The project aims to create an interactive time-lapse showing historical climate data, AI-powered future temperature predictions, and real-time environmental health impacts. The application is designed to visualize climate change effects and provide solutions through Google Maps Platform and Earth Engine APIs.

## Structure
The repository currently contains only planning documents:
- `blueprint.md`: Detailed project vision with three tiers of features
- `task.md`: Implementation plan with a 5-day schedule and specific coding tasks

## Planned Technology Stack

### Language & Runtime
**Language**: JavaScript
**Runtime**: Node.js
**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Google Maps JavaScript API
**Backend**: Express.js server

### Dependencies
**Planned Backend Dependencies**:
- express
- @google/earthengine

**Planned Frontend Dependencies**:
- TensorFlow.js
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- Google Maps Platform APIs (Air Quality, Solar, Aerial View)

## Planned Features

### Core Features
- **Historical Climate Time-Lapse**: Interactive visualization showing average annual temperature from 1980 to present
- **AI-Powered Future Prediction**: TensorFlow.js model to predict temperatures for future decades
- **Real-Time Health Impact**: Display of current Air Quality Index for Lucknow

### Advanced Features
- **Immersive 3D Impact Visualization**: Cinematic 3D fly-through of Lucknow landmarks
- **Solutions Layer**: Solar potential visualization and green spaces mapping
- **Personalized Location Analysis**: Address-specific environmental information

### Visionary Features
- **Multi-Dimensional Data Storytelling**: Additional datasets like groundwater depletion
- **Community Action & Reporting**: User-generated environmental issue reporting
- **Procedural Narrative Generation**: AI-driven personalized summary of findings

## Implementation Plan
The project is planned to be implemented over 5 days:
1. **Day 1**: Backend foundation and Earth Engine authentication
2. **Day 2**: Historical temperature time-lapse implementation
3. **Day 3**: AI prediction model and Air Quality integration
4. **Day 4**: Solar potential solutions layer and immersive aerial view
5. **Day 5**: UI/UX polish and final preparation

## Architecture Notes
- No database required - Earth Engine data stored on Google's servers
- AI training data to be stored in local data.json file
- Express server to act as secure proxy to Google Earth Engine
